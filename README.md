# DonateWater-UN_Datathon_Project

##Welcome to the DonateWater Datathon Repository! üåç

This repository is dedicated to our participation in the UN Datathon 2023. We're using citizen science, geographic information systems (GIS), and open data to tackle water scarcity in Nigeria and support the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Our mission is to identify areas with limited access to clean water, assess the impact on gender equality and climate change, and propose data-driven solutions. With over 2,000 data points collected from Nigerian communities, we're using ARCGIS and citizen science to drive positive change.
